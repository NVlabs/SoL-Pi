# Configuration

SoL-Pi reads one effective JSON configuration file at extension startup. It uses Pi's public `CONFIG_DIR_NAME` and `getAgentDir()` APIs rather than assuming fixed directories.

## Search order

1. `<working-directory>/<Pi config directory>/sol-pi.json`, only after Pi marks the project trusted
2. `<Pi agent directory>/sol-pi.json`
3. Built-in defaults when neither file exists

For the official Pi distribution, the first two locations normally resolve to `.pi/sol-pi.json` and `~/.pi/agent/sol-pi.json`.

The project file replaces the global file. SoL-Pi does not merge them.

## Schema

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "actionFusion": false,
  "observationPack": false,
  "evidencePreservingReducer": false,
  "evidencePreservingReducerProvider": "provider-id",
  "evidencePreservingReducerModel": "model-id",
  "onlineContextCompact": false,
  "trajectoryInspector": false,
  "cacheWriteReadRatio": 12.5
}
```

Feature keys may be omitted and then default to `false`. `cacheWriteReadRatio` may be omitted and then defaults to `12.5`; when present it must be a finite non-negative number, and `0` explicitly means that a cache write adds no cost relative to a cache read. `evidencePreservingReducerProvider` and `evidencePreservingReducerModel` may be omitted and then use the built-in reducer route; when present each must be a non-empty string. Unknown keys, unsupported versions, malformed JSON, non-boolean feature values, invalid ratios, and invalid reducer model fields stop extension loading with a direct error.

For the managed all-enabled installation described in the [agent installation and configuration protocol](../agents-install.md), validate the effective file before starting Pi:

```bash
node scripts/check-sol-pi-config.mjs \
  --config /absolute/path/to/effective/sol-pi.json \
  --require-all-enabled
```

This preflight does not make every valid SoL-Pi configuration all-enabled. Without `--require-all-enabled`, omitted feature keys retain their normal `false` defaults. The managed workflow uses the flag because its acceptance criterion is that all four mechanisms are active.

## Feature behavior

- `actionFusion`: registers SoL-Pi replacements for Pi's `edit` and `write` tools.
- `observationPack`: registers `obs_recall` and a provider-context projection handler.
- `evidencePreservingReducer`: registers a `tool_result` handler and delegates long diagnostic-log reduction to the configured reducer provider/model.
- `evidencePreservingReducerProvider`: provider namespace used to resolve the reducer model through Pi's model registry.
- `evidencePreservingReducerModel`: model id used for Evidence-Preserving Reducer.
- `onlineContextCompact`: registers `update_plan` and boundary-driven native compaction after the other SoL-Pi context transformers.
- `trajectoryInspector`: records a bounded metadata-only execution trajectory and shows a live TUI widget when TUI mode is active.
- `cacheWriteReadRatio`: supplies the single economic decision ratio used by Online Context Compact.

Trajectory Inspector registers the `/trajectory` command. In TUI mode it shows the most recent execution records above the editor and follows new events as they arrive. Records are also appended to `<session-directory>/sol-pi/<session-id>/trajectory-inspector/events.jsonl` for local inspection. Only metadata is stored: event kind, timestamp, status, model/tool identifiers, byte counts, durations, and correlation ids. Prompts, assistant text, tool arguments, and tool output are intentionally omitted. The inspector is observational and does not modify provider requests or agent decisions.

### Trajectory lifecycle and retention

HTTP callbacks describe individual response attempts. A request stays running
across retries and ends with the assistant message (or the turn-end fallback).
Its final status follows the assistant outcome; its detail shows the last HTTP
status received. Request duration therefore includes retries and streaming.

Compactions are recorded as informational attempts, with a separate success
record when Pi emits `session_compact`. Pi's public extension API does not
report failed or cancelled compaction outcomes. An attempt without a success
record has an unknown outcome; it is not shown as perpetually running, and no
compaction duration is claimed.

Only the in-memory widget tail is bounded. The local `events.jsonl` file is
append-only, has no automatic rotation or size cap, and remains until manually
removed. Resuming a session appends to the same file. Hiding the widget with
`/trajectory` does not stop recording. To limit further growth, disable
`trajectoryInspector` before the next Pi invocation. After stopping all Pi
processes using that session, users may archive or delete its
`trajectory-inspector` directory independently of Pi's conversation history.
Plan disk retention explicitly for long-running sessions.

## Evidence-Preserving Reducer runtime inputs

The release entry supplies the run label and session-derived storage. It uses one configurable model route:

- **Reducer provider/model** — from `evidencePreservingReducerProvider` and `evidencePreservingReducerModel` in the effective `sol-pi.json`. If omitted, SoL-Pi uses its built-in reducer route. SoL-Pi resolves that model through Pi's model registry and still relies on Pi-managed authentication; do not put credentials in `sol-pi.json`.

## Online Context Compact runtime inputs

The release entry uses two runtime inputs:

- **Context window** — from `ExtensionContext.getContextUsage()`, used for window-pressure protection.
- **Cache write/read ratio** — from `cacheWriteReadRatio` in the effective `sol-pi.json`. The value remains fixed for the session and is not recomputed when the model changes. It drives one runtime decision and is not a cost report.

The configured ratio stays fixed for the loaded extension. The mechanism stores its current plan, progress summaries, request horizon, context growth, and compaction debt as versioned custom entries in Pi's session log. After a successful compaction it sends one hidden, generic message with `triggerTurn: true`, which starts a new turn and instructs the assistant to rebuild its plan. A settlement barrier keeps print and JSON modes in the same Pi invocation until that continuation settles, so callers do not need to resume the session or inject `Continue working`. Cancelling or exiting does not schedule an automatic continuation. The mechanism creates no separate Online Context Compact files. The programmatic factory exposes only a matching retained-tail value for installations whose Pi compaction setting differs from the default.

## Pi integration

SoL-Pi reads no dedicated environment variables. Evidence-Preserving Reducer resolves its configured reducer provider/model through `ExtensionContext.modelRegistry` and uses Pi-managed authentication. If the configured reducer model is unavailable or the nested model call fails, the original tool result continues unchanged.

SoL-Pi does not configure shell paths, command prefixes, storage paths, run IDs, provider URLs, reasoning levels, timeouts, or per-mechanism enable flags through environment variables. Apart from the EPR reducer provider/model route in `sol-pi.json`, model selection remains with Pi. Action Fusion uses Pi's default shell behavior. Persistent artifacts are derived from Pi's session directory and session ID.

## Trust

A project-local config can enable file mutation, shell execution, local archival, and remote diagnostic-log reduction. SoL-Pi waits for Pi's `session_start` context and ignores the project file unless `ctx.isProjectTrusted()` is true. Prefer the global file when you want one personal configuration across trusted projects.
